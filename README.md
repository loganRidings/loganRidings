### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Check out my website! [Portfolio](https://loganridings.org)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Creating an ASL translation model. I'm currently in the early stages, just classifying alphabet symbols. The next step is to expand the vocabulary of the classification model, implement a version of the model which can run in real-time on video, and lastly, create a tranformer model to translate to American English. ASL is unsimilar grammatically to English, which makes it an interesting case for a transformer model, which could learn to translate the semantics of the ASL sequence to the grammatical structure of English.
